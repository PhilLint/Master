According to our Entity definition, all possible states are created
All possible states are created as a list (valid and invalid) with a total of :39366
  States not consistent with correspondences are deleted
  States not consistent with system constraints and proportionalities are deleted
  States not consistent with influences are deleted
  Only valid states left. A total of: 24

Find parent and children nodes for graph by filling an adjacency list (state transitions)
   Given: exogenous variable [inflow] with start derivative: [increasing]
   Derive possible starting states based on exogenous derivative
   Build adjacency list: which originally valid state is a neighbor to which other valid state
   For every possible starting state (based on exogenous derivative), find possible following states
       Gather instanteous (e.g. (0,+) -> (+,+)) and possibly changing quantities
       Instanteous quantity possible: apply all instanteous changes to obtain a new state
       Quantities are changed (instanteous and all possible combinations) according to derivatives
   Possible children based on these transitions are added to adjacency_list
All children for all possible start states are created, thus adjacency list is complete
Adjacency list is transformed to graph format by changing entity objects to strings
       Example: possibly changing quantity: outflow: (+,-)
       Example: instanteous changing quantity: inflow: (0,+)

       No instanteous quantity possible: create a list of every possible combination of changable quantities to explore
       No instanteous quantity possible: apply according transitions to each combination and add original state as no transitions is an option as well
